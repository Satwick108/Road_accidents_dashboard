# Road_accidents_dashboard

This project showcases an interactive and visually engaging dashboard that provides insights into road accidents that occurred in 2022. The dashboard aggregates and visualizes key metrics such as the number of accidents by day of the week, severity by age group, accident causes, and location types (e.g., residential areas, industrial zones). It also breaks down the data by vehicle types, such as automobiles, lorries, public transport, and taxis, offering a clearer understanding of how different vehicles contribute to road accidents.

The dashboard features multiple charts, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, each designed to help users explore specific dimensions of road safety. For instance, the “Cause of Accidents” chart highlights the most frequent reasons for accidents, such as changing lanes, driving under the influence, or overloading. Additionally, the pie chart on lighting scenarios shows how accidents vary under different conditions (e.g., daylight, dark with lights, dark without lights), providing valuable insights into environmental factors that affect road safety.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for analyzing road safety patterns and can be used by policymakers, safety organizations, and the general public to understand trends and take preventive measures. The design prioritizes ease of use and clarity, with an aesthetically pleasing color scheme and well-organized data, making it accessible for users with various levels of expertise.
